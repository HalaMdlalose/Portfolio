User Manual: Running My Portfolio

Purpose
This guide will help you download and run my portfolio project on your local machine. The instructions are simple and suitable for non-technical users.

Note: These instructions assume a macOS environment. If you're using Windows, the steps are similar, but there might be slight differences in how things are named or where they are located.
Step 1: Install Necessary Software
Before you start, make sure you have the following software installed on your Mac:

Safari (or any other web browser): This is where you'll view the portfolio.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): This is the program we'll use to view and run the project.
Instructions to Install Visual Studio Code:

Step 1.1: Open your web browser and go to Visual Studio Code Download
Step 1.2: Click the "Download for macOS" button.
Step 1.3: Once the download is complete, open the .dmg file and drag Visual Studio Code into the Applications folder to install it.
Step 2: Unzip the Project Folder
Once you receive the zipped folder, you’ll need to unzip it to access the project files.

Instructions to Unzip the Folder:

Step 2.1: Save the zipped folder to a location on your Mac (e.g., the Desktop or Downloads folder).
Step 2.2: Double-click on the zipped folder to automatically extract its contents.
Step 3: Open the Project in Visual Studio Code
Now that you have the project files on your computer, you can open them in Visual Studio Code.

Instructions to Open the Project:

Step 3.1: Open Visual Studio Code from your Applications folder.
Step 3.2: Click on "File" in the top menu, then select "Open."
Step 3.3: Navigate to the folder where you extracted the files in Step 2.2, select it, and click "Open."
Step 4: Install Project Dependencies
After opening the project in Visual Studio Code, you need to install some additional tools (dependencies) that the project needs to run.

Instructions to Install Dependencies:

Step 4.1: In Visual Studio Code, open the terminal by clicking "Terminal" in the top menu and then "New Terminal."
Step 4.2: In the terminal window that opens at the bottom, type the following command and press Enter:
bash
Copy code
npm install
This command tells your computer to download all the necessary files for the project.

Step 5: Run the Project
Now you’re ready to run the project and see the portfolio in action.

Instructions to Run the Project:

Step 5.1: After the dependencies have been installed, type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:
bash
Copy code
npm start
Step 5.2: Wait a few moments while the project starts up. Your web browser should automatically open a new tab showing the portfolio. If it doesn’t, you can open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
